# Preview: AWS Amplify's new code-first DX (Gen 2) for building backends

This next generation of Amplifyâ€™s backend building experience lets you author your frontend and backend definition completely with TypeScript, a file convention, and Git branch-based environments, is now available in Preview. To learn more, please visit [AWS Amplify (Gen 2)](https://docs.amplify.aws/gen2/).

## Quickstart

```bash
npm create amplify@latest
```

## Package Manager Support

- NPM, Yarn, PNPM are officially supported.
- NodeJS 20 or later version is required for Yarn because of the NodeJS [loader bug](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/43772) causing yarn [chain loader error](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/4694).
- Yarn PnP is not supported. Run `yarn config set nodeLinker node-modules` to use "node-modules".
