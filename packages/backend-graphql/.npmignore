# Be very careful editing this file. It is crafted to work around [this issue](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/4479)

# First ignore everything
**/*

# Then add back in transpiled js and ts declaration files
!lib/**/*.js
!lib/**/*.d.ts

# Then ignore test js and ts declaration files
*.test.js
*.test.d.ts

# This leaves us with including only js and ts declaration files of functional code
