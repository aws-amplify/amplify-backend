  We should be very careful about how much logic we add to this package.
  If this grows beyond just copying template files, we probably should put that logic into @aws-amplify/cli and delegate to it here
  This is because packages that run as part of `npm create *` are cached in the global npx cache which is cumbersome to update / clean.
  If customers have a cached version of the create-amplify package, they might execute that cached version even after we publish features and fixes to the package on npm.
