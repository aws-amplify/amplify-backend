/**
 * Provides an abstractions for sending and receiving data on stdin/out of a child process
 *
 * The general strategy is to read stdout of the child process line by line and consume a queue of actions as output is ingested.
 *
 * When .run() is called, the child process is spawned and the actions are awaited and executed one by one
 *
 * Each action is essentially a condition to wait for stdout to satisfy and some data to send on stdin once the wait condition is met
 *
 * For example `.waitForLineIncludes('Do you like M&Ms').sendLine('yes')`
 * will wait until a line that includes "Do you like M&Ms" is printed on stdout of the child process,
 * then send "yes" on stdin of the process
